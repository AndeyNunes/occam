	New notation for dependent and independent variables is
	supported now.

	Old format:
	-1      omit the variable
	 0      independent variable
         1      dependent variable

	New format:
         0      omit the variable
         1      independent variable
         2      dependent variable

        To translate data files from old to new format use perl
        script old2new. It accepts a list of files as its arguments
        and translates them to the new format. The old format files
	are renamed by adding '.old' suffix, the new format files take
        the names of the original data files.
