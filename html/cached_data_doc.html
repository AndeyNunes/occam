<b>
   To Upload and Cache Data and Test Files:
</b>
<br/>
Given:
<ul>
    <li>variable declarations file (containing everything except the :data and :test blocks) </li>
    <li>data file (containing only the :data block)</li>
    <li>(optional) test file (containing only the :test block)</li>
</ul>

OCCAM will cache the data file on the server.
The file will be saved using a new name (<i>Cached Data Name</i>)
made by concatenating the original file name and a timestamp.

Optionally, OCCAM can also cache a test file in the same fashion.
<br/><br/>

Then, OCCAM will print the <i>Cached Data Name</i> and, if used, the <i>Cached Test Name</i>
for future reference,
concatenate the variable declarations and data, 
and run as normal on the combined file.

If a <i>Data File</i> is submitted and the <i>Cached Data Name</i> field is not empty,
OCCAM will terminate immediately (to avoid uploading the data).

<br/><br/>

<b>
  To Use Previously Cached Files:
</b>
<br/>
Given:
<ul>
    <li>variable declaration file </li>
    <li><i>Cached Data Name</i> from a previous OCCAM run</li>
    <li>(optional) <i>Cached Test Name</i> from a previous OCCAM run</li>
</ul>

OCCAM will search for the cached data file by the <i>Cached Data Name</i>.
If given, OCCAM will search for a corresponding test file by the <i>Cached Test Name</i>.

<br/>
If the files are found, OCCAM will attempt use the variable declaration file
and the previously cached files to run as normal.
<br/>

If the variable declarations, data, and test (if given) are incompatible,
or no cached file is found corresponding to the names given,
OCCAM will fail and emit an error message.
