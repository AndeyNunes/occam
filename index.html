Occam is an Discrete Multivariate Modeling (DMM) tool based on the methodology of
Reconstructability Analysis (RA). Its typical usage is for analysis of problems involving large
numbers of discrete variables. <i>Models</i> are developed which consist of one or more <i>components</i>,
which are then evaluated for their fit and statistical significance. Occam can search the lattice of
all possible models, or can do detailed analysis on a specific model.
<p>
In <i>Variable Based Modeling (VBM)</i>, model components are collections of variables. In
<i>State Based Modeling (SBM)</i>, components identify one or more specific states or substates.
<p>
Occam provides a web-based interface, which allows uploading a data file, performing analysis, and viewing
or downloading results.
